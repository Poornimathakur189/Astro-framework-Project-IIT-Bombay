Date: 26th April, 2024 

Introduction 

This document will provide an overview of my internship screening task at FOSSEE Summer Fellowship 2024 , IIT  Bombay, where I successfully converted a static website into the Astro framework. I will walk through the steps I took, the challenges I faced, the things I learned through the task and the outcome of the project.  

Task Overview 

This task at hand involves converting an existing static website into the Astro framework and deploying it using Netlify. This entails a comprehensive examination of the website's HTML structure, including identifying reusable components like headers and footers, and assessing CSS styles and any custom frameworks employed. This also involves analysis of JavaScript functionality to understand dynamic behavior and dependencies, while evaluating content layout and responsiveness across devices, noting any inconsistencies for improvement. Furthermore, checking Media integration, such as images and videos, for compatibility with Astro's handling, and the website's existing grid system is assessed for integration with the framework's grid system. Overall, the goal is to ensure a seamless transition to the Astro framework while maintaining the website's functionality and aesthetics. 

Approach 

Approaching the task involved a systematic process to ensure a seamless transition to the Astro framework while preserving the original website's functionality and aesthetic. I looked at the website and its functionality and then did the analysis by grouping as follows: 

1. Component Analysis: I thoroughly examined the components used in the original website and identified their functionalities. This analysis helped me understand the structure and functionality of the website better. 

2. Page Layouts: I reviewed the different page layouts present in the original website and made note of their specific design elements and requirements. This step was crucial in ensuring that the converted website maintained the same aesthetic appeal and user experience. 

3. Cloning the Basic Template: After understanding the existing website's components and page layouts, I cloned a basic template in the Astro framework. This served as the foundation for rebuilding the website. 

4. Design Elements: I incorporated the design elements from the original website into the Astro framework. This included the main content, navigation bar, and a grey color theme. The focus was on ensuring the smooth flow of the website and maintaining consistency with the original design. 

5. Code Organization: To enhance the maintainability and readability of the code, I split the single HTML file of the original website into multiple components. Each component was organized and assigned its appropriate place in the layout files. 

Challenges Faced 

Throughout the internship screening task, I encountered a few challenges that required problem-solving and critical thinking. Some of the challenges I faced include: 

1. Resolving Image Issues During the Conversion Process: 

Challenge: During the conversion process, I encountered difficulties with image handling. The original website contained images that were not displaying correctly or were misaligned after the conversion. 

Resolution: 

- Image Optimization: I tackled this challenge by optimizing the images before integration into the framework. This involved resizing images to appropriate dimensions and compressing them to reduce file size without compromising quality. 

- Path Verification: I meticulously verified the image paths in the HTML and CSS files to ensure they were correctly referenced. Any discrepancies were identified and rectified promptly. 

- Compatibility Testing: To ensure cross-browser compatibility, I conducted extensive testing across different browsers and devices to confirm that images rendered consistently and displayed as intended. 

2. Splitting Code from Single HTML File into Multiple Components: 

Challenge: One of the tasks involved splitting a substantial chunk of code from a single HTML file into multiple components and correctly assigning them in the layout files. 

Resolution: Component Identification: I began by identifying distinct sections within the HTML code that could be separated into individual components. This involved analyzing the code structure and identifying recurring patterns or functional units. 

I modularized the code by breaking it down into logical components such as headers, footers, navigation bars, and content sections. Each component was encapsulated within its own HTML file. 

- Integration with Layout Files: After splitting the code into components, I integrated them into the appropriate layout files within the chosen framework. This involved referencing each component in the layout hierarchy and ensuring seamless integration with existing styles and functionalities. 

- Testing and Validation: Finally, I conducted rigorous testing to validate the functionality and responsiveness of the website after the code restructuring. Any inconsistencies or errors were addressed promptly to ensure a smooth user experience. 

By systematically addressing these challenges, I was able to overcome obstacles encountered during the internship screening task, demonstrating adaptability, problem-solving skills, and attention to detail in the conversion process.
